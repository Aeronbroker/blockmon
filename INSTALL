BLOCKMON INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==============================================
To compile blockmon you will need gcc version 4.6 or higher (earlier 
versions might work but have not be tested) as well as 
cmake 2.8 or higher. In addition, you will need several external libaries 
(see below) which need to be installed into the /lib/external directory.

Python 2.5 or higher is required for using the blockmon CLI. The daemon and
GUI further require the twisted json-rpc package:

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txJSON-RPC/ 

and the json pickle package:

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonpickle (jsonpickle webpage)

For more information on the CLI, daemon and GUI please see the README file.

EXTERNAL LIBRARIES
------------------
Several external libraries have to be installed into the /lib/external 
directory. Follow the individual scripts listed here to do so.

1. Crypto-Pan
   cd lib/external/crypto
   wget http://www.cc.gatech.edu/computing/Networking/projects/cryptopan/Crypto-PAn.1.0.tar.gz
   tar xzf Crypto-PAn.1.0.tar.gz
   mv Crypto-PAn.1.0/* .
   rmdir Crypto-PAn.1.0   
   cd ../../..
2. PugiXML
   cd lib/external/pugixml
   wget http://pugixml.googlecode.com/files/pugixml-1.2.tar.gz
   tar xzf pugixml-1.2.tar.gz
   cd ../../..
3. libfc (you need GIT installed for this) 
   cd lib
   git://github.com/britram/libfc.git fc
   cd ..

PORTABILITY
-------------
In theory should build on various systems including Linux and Windows, though
so far this has only been tested on the former.

PFQ
--------------
Blockmon supports PFQ (http://netgroup.iet.unipi.it/software/pfq/), an
accelerated packet capture engine designed for multi-core architectures.
By default the block of PFQ wil not be built; if you want to enable it
you have to give the -DWITH_PFQ=ON to cmake (see below).

The source code of PFQ is available from the public github repository
at https://github.com/pfq/PFQ.
Please note that before building Blockmon with -DWITH_PFQ, PFQ must be
installed on the system.

Please follow the instruction shipped with the package to install it.

Once PFQ is installed in the system, place the user-level PFQ header file
in the Blockmon build tree:

cp [PFQDIR]/user/c++/pfq.hpp [BLOCKMONDIR]/lib/external/pfq/

If the directory [BLOCKMONDIR]/lib/external/pfq/ does not exist just create it.


IPFIX
--------------
Blockmon supports IPFIX (http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ipfix/charter/) through a block
called IPFIXExporter. In order to build it, you will need to have the boost libraries
installed (http://www.boost.org/).

COMBO SZE2
--------------
Blockmon supports SZE2 interface for high speed data transfer from INVEA-TECH [1]
hardware acceleratorion cards COMBO. In order to build it, you will need to have
the NetCOPE development platform [2] and COMBO card [3] installed, and you will
need to run cmake with -DWITH_COMBO=ON (see below).

INSTALL
--------------
On the main directory type

cmake .

If you would like to build optional features (or remove them) the syntax is

cmake -D<feature>=ON|OFF

Currently supported features are:

WITH_PFQ: Support for PFQ-based capture block
WITH_COMBO: Support for COMBO acceleration cards
WITH_DAEMON: Support for a json-rpc, python-based control daemon plus the CLI
	     (if you specify WITH_DAEMON=OFF the txJSON-RPC library is not required)

Note that options passed with -D will persist across independent runs of cmake. For
instance, if you first run cmake with -DWITH_PFQ=ON and then run it without it,
the second run will also have -DWITH_PFQ=ON even if not explicitly given on the 
command line. To revert this you would have to run cmake with -DWITH_PFQ=OFF; 
subsequent runs will keep this value implicitly.

When cmake is finished, type:

make

That's it!

ERRORS
--------------
- If you get the error:

Could NOT find PythonLibs (missing: PYTHON_LIBRARIES PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS)

install the python-dev package. Under a Debian-based system:

sudo apt-get install python-dev

- If you're building blockmon with the daemon and cli and you get a link error
  at the end of the build you may be missing the python boost libraries. Install
  them with

  apt-get install libboost-python1.42.0 libboost-python1.42-dev
